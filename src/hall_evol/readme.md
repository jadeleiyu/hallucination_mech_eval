To evaluate LMs on the ParaRel dataset:

1. Download the dataframe of ParaRel questions from https://github.com/jadeleiyu/hallucination_mech_evol/blob/main/data/pararel_questions.csv
2. Change ```model_dir``` in ```pararel_lm_eval.py``` into the directory of your LMs to evaluate; change ```data_dir``` into the directory of the pararel_questions.csv file that you just saved; change ```results_dir``` into the directory that you will save model outputs.
